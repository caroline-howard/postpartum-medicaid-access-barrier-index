# Medicaid Access Barriers Power BI Dashboard

Power BI portfolio project analyzing geographic access to Medicaid office locations and county-level administrative access barriers using public health, demographic, and spatial data.

## Main Research Question

Where may in-person Medicaid enrollment support be limited relative to population need, transportation barriers, and digital access constraints?

## Planned Data Sources

- Shafer et al. 2024 geocoded Medicaid office locations dataset from Harvard Dataverse
- Census or ACS county-level demographic indicators
- CMS Medicaid enrollment data
- Rural-urban classification data
- Optional CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index

## Planned Power BI Report Pages

1. National Medicaid Office Access Map
2. State Comparison
3. County Access Gaps
4. Access Barrier Index
5. Data Notes and Limitations

## Current Project Status

Data-processing scaffolding is underway. Current scripts clean the Medicaid office dataset, assign offices to counties, build a complete 50-state/D.C. county office access base, add ACS access-barrier indicators, and add NCHS rural-urban classification. CMS enrollment, access-barrier index development, and Power BI report construction have not started yet.

## Data Source Setup

The primary data source is the Shafer et al. 2024 geocoded Medicaid office locations dataset from Harvard Dataverse. The raw Excel file should be saved locally as `data/raw/medicaid_offices.xlsx`.

Raw data should remain unchanged. Cleaning, county spatial joins, access-barrier measures, and export-ready tables will be handled in later scripts. This setup step does not perform analysis yet.

## Current Data Pipeline

1. Raw Medicaid office Excel file: `data/raw/medicaid_offices.xlsx`
2. Clean Medicaid office CSV: `data/processed/medicaid_offices_clean.csv`
3. County-assigned office file: `data/processed/medicaid_offices_with_county.csv`
4. Complete county office access base table: `data/processed/county_office_access_base.csv`
5. ACS county access-barrier indicators: `data/processed/acs_county_access_indicators.csv`
6. Rural-urban classification: `data/processed/rural_urban_county_classification.csv`
7. Future step: build access-barrier index
8. Future step: build Power BI report

## Notes on Limitations

- The project will identify potential geographic and administrative access barriers; it will not claim that office availability causes Medicaid enrollment outcomes.
- The Medicaid office dataset is a point-in-time public dataset and should not be presented as a live office locator.
- County-level indicators may hide important within-county variation, especially in large rural counties and dense urban counties.
- Processed datasets are generated locally and are not committed to the repository.
