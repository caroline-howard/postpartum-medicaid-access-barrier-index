# Postpartum Medicaid Access Barriers Power BI Dashboard

Power BI portfolio project identifying where postpartum Medicaid populations may face greater administrative access barriers after delivery using geocoded Medicaid office locations, county-level demographic and access indicators, rural-urban context, and hospital-based obstetric care status.

## Main Research Question

Where may postpartum Medicaid populations face greater administrative access barriers to maintaining coverage and navigating support after delivery?

## Project Purpose

This project uses geocoded Medicaid office locations, county-level ACS indicators, and rural-urban context to identify counties where limited office availability overlaps with postpartum-relevant access barriers.

The goal is to support a policy-facing screening dashboard for identifying places that may warrant closer review, outreach, or support planning. It is not designed as a causal analysis of Medicaid enrollment, retention, or health outcomes.

The dashboard distinguishes Medicaid office availability as administrative and enrollment support access from hospital-based obstetric care status as clinical maternity access context.

## Planned Data Sources

- Shafer et al. 2024 geocoded Medicaid office locations dataset from Harvard Dataverse
- Census or ACS county-level demographic indicators
- Hospital-based obstetric care status
- CMS Medicaid enrollment data, optional state-level context only
- Rural-urban classification data
- CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index, deferred comparison/context layer

## Planned Power BI Report Pages

1. National Postpartum Medicaid Access Overview
2. Administrative vs. Clinical Access
3. County Access Gaps
4. Potential Postpartum Medicaid Administrative Access Barrier Index
5. State Comparison
6. Data Notes and Limitations

## Potential Postpartum Medicaid Administrative Access Barrier Index

Planned score components:

- No Medicaid office in county = 2 points
- No hospital-based obstetric care = 2 points
- Top quartile poverty rate = 1 point
- Top quartile no-vehicle household rate = 1 point
- Top quartile no-internet subscription rate = 1 point
- Top quartile limited English rate = 1 point
- Top quartile disability rate = 1 point
- Top quartile female population ages 15-44 rate = 1 point
- Nonmetro county = 1 point

Planned score range: 0-11 points

Planned concern levels:

- 0-2 = Lower concern
- 3-5 = Moderate concern
- 6-8 = High concern
- 9-11 = Highest concern

Population age 65+ is not included in the planned score or dashboard context because this project is focused on postpartum Medicaid access barriers. Disability rate remains included as a county-level access-support context measure, not as a direct measure of postpartum disability or pregnancy-related disability.

## Current Project Status

The first-version data layers have been pulled and merged through the county analytic base: Medicaid office locations, county assignment, complete county office base table, ACS access-barrier indicators, female population ages 15-44, NCHS rural-urban classification, and hospital-based obstetric care status.

The county-level Potential Postpartum Medicaid Administrative Access Barrier Index is built by `scripts/08_build_postpartum_access_barrier_index.py`. Power BI export packaging and report construction have not started yet.

## Data Source Setup

The primary data source is the Shafer et al. 2024 geocoded Medicaid office locations dataset from Harvard Dataverse. The raw Excel file should be saved locally as `data/raw/medicaid_offices.xlsx`.

Raw data should remain unchanged. Cleaning, county spatial joins, postpartum-relevant access-barrier measures, and export-ready tables will be handled by scripts. This documentation step does not add new data or perform index calculations.

## Current Data Pipeline

1. Raw Medicaid office Excel file: `data/raw/medicaid_offices.xlsx`
2. Clean Medicaid office CSV: `data/processed/medicaid_offices_clean.csv`
3. County-assigned Medicaid office file: `data/processed/medicaid_offices_with_county.csv`
4. Complete county office access base table: `data/processed/county_office_access_base.csv`
5. ACS county access-barrier indicators, including female population ages 15-44: `data/processed/county_office_access_with_acs.csv`
6. NCHS rural-urban classification: `data/processed/county_office_access_with_acs_rurality.csv`
7. Hospital-based obstetric care status: `data/processed/county_postpartum_access_analytic_base.csv`
8. Potential Postpartum Medicaid Administrative Access Barrier Index: `data/processed/county_postpartum_access_index.csv`
9. Power BI export package: `powerbi/data/`

## Power BI Export Package

The Power BI export package creates clean dashboard-ready CSVs under `powerbi/data/`. Power BI should import the county index file, Medicaid office point file, and state summary file.

The export package does not create the Power BI report itself. The Power BI report will be built manually in Power BI Desktop.

## Notes on Limitations

- The dashboard does not identify individual postpartum Medicaid enrollees.
- The Potential Postpartum Medicaid Administrative Access Barrier Index is a screening tool, not a causal measure.
- The project will identify potential geographic and administrative access barriers; it will not claim that office availability causes Medicaid enrollment, retention, or health outcomes.
- The Medicaid office dataset is a point-in-time public dataset and should not be presented as a live office locator.
- County-level indicators may hide important within-county variation, especially in large rural counties and dense urban counties.
- Medicaid office availability does not capture all enrollment assistance, online support, navigators, health systems, or community-based support.
- Hospital-based obstetric care status captures clinical maternity access context and does not measure Medicaid administrative or enrollment support.
- Female population ages 15-44 is a proxy for reproductive-age population context, not a direct measure of postpartum need.
- Raw and processed datasets are generated or stored locally and are not committed to the repository.
