## Planned Index Context Notes

- Population age 65+ is not part of the planned postpartum index or dashboard context.
- Disability rate remains a planned scoring component as a county-level access-support context measure, not as a direct measure of postpartum disability or pregnancy-related disability.
- `female_15_44_rate` is the postpartum-relevant reproductive-age population proxy.
