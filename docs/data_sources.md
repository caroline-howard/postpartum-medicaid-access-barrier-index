# Data Sources

This file documents the planned source inventory for the Medicaid Access Barriers Power BI project. Raw data files should remain unchanged in `data/raw/`; cleaning and derived outputs should be created by scripts in later milestones.

## A. Medicaid Office Locations

- Source: Shafer et al. 2024 / Harvard Dataverse
- Article: "A dataset of geocoded Medicaid office locations in the United States"
- DOI: `10.7910/DVN/AVRHMI`
- Expected file: `data/raw/medicaid_offices.xlsx`
- First cleaned analytic file: `data/processed/medicaid_offices_clean.csv`
- Purpose: Core office location dataset
- Key fields: state, address, latitude, longitude
- Expected columns: `state_fips`, `state_name`, `agency_name`, `street1`, `street2`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- Limitation: Point-in-time dataset current as of late 2023; not a live office locator
- Status: Not added yet

## B. County Boundaries

## C. ACS County Indicators
